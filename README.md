## Installation

```sh
#npm
npm install --save @react-native-toolkit/triangle

#yarn
yarn add @react-native-toolkit/triangle
```

## Motivation

Triangles are an important part of user interfaces and I needed full control over the triangle dimensions. I initially tried [react-native-triangle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-triangle) but I had very less control over the triangle properties. Especially scalene & isosceles triangles.

This library is focused on providing an easy API to create all possible triangles based on the [CSS Triangle Generator](http://apps.eky.hk/css-triangle-generator/)

## Usage

By default, the Triangle component renders an equilateral triangle

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Triangle from "@react-native-toolkit/triangle";

const App = () => {
  return <Triangle mode={"top"} base={50} color={"red"} />;
};
```

This will render an equilateral triangle of color "red" & side - 50

### Properties

#### Equilateral Triangle - All three sides equal

##### `type?: "equilateral"`

Type of the triangle. Optional for equilateral triangle

##### `mode: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"`

Direction in which the triangle is facing

##### `base: number`

Length of the base & since it's equilateral all the sides have the length of the base

##### `color: string`

Color of the triangle

#### Isosceles Triangle - Two sides of the triangle are equal

##### `type: "isosceles"`

Type of the triangle.

##### `mode: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"`

Direction in which the triangle is facing

##### `base: number`

Length of the base

##### `height: number`

Height of the triangle from base to the peak. The two connecting sides will have the equal length.

##### `color: string`

Color of the triangle

#### Scalene Triangle - All three sides of the triangle have different lengths

##### `type: "scalene"`

Type of the triangle.

##### `mode: "top" | "bottom" | "left" | "right"`

Direction in which the triangle is facing

##### `height: number`

Height of the triangle from base to the peak.

##### `left: number`

Length of the side on the left of the line representing height of the triangle.

##### `right: number`

Length of the side on the right of the line representing height of the triangle.

##### `color: string`

Color of the triangle

#### Right Angled Triangle - A triangle with angle of 90¬∞ on one of it's sides

##### `type: "rightAngle"`

Type of the triangle.

##### `mode: "top-left" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right"`

Direction in which the triangle is facing

##### `base: number`

Length of the base

##### `height: number`

Height of the triangle from base to the peak. The two connecting sides will have the equal length.

##### `color: string`

Color of the triangle

#### ViewProps

All existing `ViewProps` are supported by this component as it extends the `<View/>` component. However, it cannot have any children as creating a triangle requires height & width of the `View` to be 0.
